# M3.2 Lab

This project involves creating a well-structured HTML document to represent a formal letter. The letter is a response from Dr. Eleanor Gaye, a research fellow at the University of Awesome, to a prospective PhD student, Miss Eileen Dover, regarding her application to the university. The letter is intended to be hosted on the university's intranet and adheres to modern web standards, including proper HTML semantics, accessibility, and clean code practices.
